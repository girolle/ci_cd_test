# web_project_3
From Portland to Portland. An epic bicycle journey from Portland, ME to Portland, OR.

 Enter **web_project_3**  after two sprints have previously taken place. The trifecta being produced in consequence to a three sprint production period culminating as a kind of showcase for students of Practicom by Yandex
to use as a skills list and portfolio piece. The *thoroughly comprehensive* tasks entailing the creation of each component piece of this project-website are exhaustive of the materials presented to students at the beginning of each sprint. The final projects work as an opportunity for the student to reinforce what they have learned throughout the lessons and theory portion of the sprint and apply it directly to a real-world __student instantiated__ repository and website loaded through a browser (Chrome recommended). This third project really is oriented toward the student retention of responsive design functionality. We used many facets of web development during this sprint of course but it's primary focus was building a web page that can be opened on any device. Even devices made of cheese.

This repository contains code written by a Practicom by Yandex student with less than one years working development
experience and is still in need of review by Practicom cadre. [https://zbozon.github.io/web_project_3/]
